![wuav photo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dermike/wuaw/master/screenshot/product.jpg)

### Description
This web app collects and displays individual staff or employee vacation preferences. It was made out of the frustration of previously using a shared Excel spreadsheet for the same purpose.

The backend needed to store and fetch data is not included since requirements and platforms vary, but JSON example responses are used in this implementation and available in ```js/responses```.

Any compiling of overviews and statistics also need to be handled by the backend.
